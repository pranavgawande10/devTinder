💘 DevTinder — Where Code Finds Its Perfect Match

Because great projects start with the right people.

DevTinder is a full-stack networking platform for developers, inspired by the swipe-based discovery of dating apps. Instead of dating, developers connect to collaborate on projects, hackathons, startups, or mentorship—all based on skills, interests, and mutual intent.

Swipe smart. Match better. Build faster. 🚀
